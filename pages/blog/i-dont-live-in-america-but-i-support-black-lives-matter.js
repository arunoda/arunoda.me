[Try to do the same.](https://www.obama.org/anguish-and-action/)

I don't know much about US politics or a lot about the current situation. But things I saw on Twitter and News is just wrong. 

At the same time, I don't support violence and hurting innocent people â€” no matter which side they are. I am not in a position to advise anyone. But act peacefully and respect everyone.

## So, why am I supporting?

I don't think this is only about Black people or related to recent events anymore. It's about injustice. 

In these years, I have work with many American contributors and friends with open-source projects like [Meteor](https://twitter.com/meteorjs), [Storybook](https://twitter.com/storybookjs), and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). So, it's my responsibility to help them when they are in trouble.

<br/>

# Here are some questions you might ask?
<br/>

**Are you just following the Twitter trend?**

In a way, Yes. I follow fellow open-source leaders like [@rauchg](https://twitter.com/rauchg), [@dan_abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) and [@stolinski](https://twitter.com/stolinski).
What's wrong with that?
<br/>
<br/>

**I live in country XXX; I don't care what happens in the US?**

Even though you don't care, there are many software products, open-source libraries written and contributed by many Americans. So, you are here writing apps, because of them. You need to help them in a situation like this.

I don't ask you to donate or riot. At least try to understand what's going on.
<br/>
<br/>

**See, these rioters are hurting innocent people. Why the fuck I want to support this?**

Me too. If there is violence, police and law enforcement should handle it properly. They deserve any lawful punishment. But still, I don't think that's the majority.
<br/>
<br/>

**Our country had similar events; Americans didn't care about that?**

That could be true. Do you want to do the same? Consider this as an opportunity to bring everyone together and fight injustice. This event should be a lesson for the whole world.
